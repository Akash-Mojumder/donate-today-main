            <p class="first-paragraph">Today, 690 million people around the world will go to bed on an empty stomach. But your  gift means that one less child will be at risk of starvation tonight.
            By starting a monthly gift, you can change a life forever. Often, one meal at the right time can be enough to make a difference between life and death. </p>

Millions of people give to charity on a regular basis to support causes they believe in, as well as for the positive effect it has on their own lives.</p>

            <h1>Our Donate Plan</h1>
                <p>Since 1937, Plan International has been promoting the rights of children around the    world. With support from our incredible donors, we’re active in over 70 countries, making sure children and communities in the world’s most fragile states are safe and protected from violence.

                Working in partnership with communities, we’re providing access to essential services. And we’re there when disasters happen – providing emergency relief and supporting communities to recover, rebuild and develop their resilience.</p>

            <p class="plan-heading-paragraph">Evidence suggests that family meals influence food intakes and behaviours, which in   turn impact children’s eating habits, diets and health. Mealtimes therefore offer potential as settings for health promotion. Given diet, health behaviours and health are often socioeconomically patterned, it is important to consider whether family meals differ by socioeconomic position (SEP).</p>

            <P class="plan-heading-paragraph">Parents with children are a growing segment of the U.S. homeless population. Sources indicate that homeless shelter dormitory bedrooms are highly crowded with low privacy, which may affect quality of experience that lead to residents' perceived loss of control and helplessness. Research suggests that personal environmental control features may lessen these effects and increase a resident's sense of internal control (that outcomes are based on one's own behavior). Internal control can support one's motivation to seek a permanent place to live and find employment. To enhance the sense of internal control, the author of this study altered a homeless shelter bedroom, adding a series of control features including lighting for reading, bed curtains, and increased storage.</P>

                <p class="plan-heading-paragraph">A child’s right to education entails the right to learn. Yet, for too many children across the globe, schooling does not lead to learning.
                Over 600 million children and adolescents worldwide are unable to attain minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics, even though two thirds of them are in school. For out-of-school children, foundational skills in literacy and numeracy are further from grasp. <br>

                <p>Following natural disasters like a hurricane or earthquake, many people rely on the generosity of strangers to help rebuild their lives. Donations to disaster relief organizations, local food and diaper banks, and other charities can make a big difference to people in great need.
                However, we know that not everyone who can donate to these organizations ends up opening their wallets. In fact, a phenomenon known as compassion collapse (or fade) can make people less generous following catastrophic situations—or any time we are faced with many people in nee</p>

                <p>Online donations are the ‘bread and butter’ but critical response to ensure those who need it most have food on their table; clothes on their back; the healthcare they need; access to safe water and sanitation; an opportunity to keep learning; and a roof over their head. Financial aid from donors is the sustainable backbone of every humanitarian and charity organization’s existence. This support enables the immediate emergency response, which helps protect those who are most impacted and provides the support and opportunities that children and communities need to thrive again. 
                The maxim, ‘Money makes the world go around,’ takes on a survival element for humanitarian organizations and the people most in need when it comes to making a difference in under-resourced communities. Your donation enables a focussed, professional and efficient response to the great need.</p>
